Example PHP project
===================

The purpose of this repository is to show how to use GitLab to do
Continuous Integration with a PHP project. It serves as a companion project for
<http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ci/languages/php.html>.

In order to run this project just fork it on GitLab.com.
Every push will then trigger a new build on GitLab.
